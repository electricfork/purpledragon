Usage: purpledragon.py [options]

Purple Dragon was the code name for a military research project that developed
the idea of "operations security".  purpledragon.py creates random identifiers
based on two file dictionaries to allow casual reference to a various event
between two parties.  This could also be used to generate a challenge/response
pair though that hasn't been added as an option

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -a ADJECTIVE, --adjective=ADJECTIVE
                        adjective file to use
  -n NOUN, --noun=NOUN  noun file to use
  -q QUANTITY, --quantity=QUANTITY
                        output X number of identifiers
